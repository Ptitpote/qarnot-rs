# The (unofficial) Qarnot rust SDK.

## Introduction

This SDK works in a similar way to the official python SDK, you can even use the same config file !

## TODO

 - [ ] Pools support
 - [ ] Jobs support
 - [ ] Pagination support
 - [ ] Better error management
 - [ ] Improve task constants usage (I'm not satisfied)

## Notes

The low level SDK models have been generated using [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#34---license-information-on-generated-code) with
some tweaks to the generated code.
